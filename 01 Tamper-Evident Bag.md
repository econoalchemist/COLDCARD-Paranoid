## Checking the tamper-evident bag:
Upon receiving your COLDCARD, ensure that the tamper-evident bag has not been compromised. If anything seems amiss or if you have any problems contact [support@coinkite.com](mailto:support@coinkite.com?subject=%5BContact%5D%20-%20). Visually inspect the surfaces and edges of the bag for indications of tampering, openings, or damage. The concern is being victim of a supply chain attack in which your COLDCARD gets intercepted in transit and modified in a way that puts your funds at risk. Ensuring the integrity of the tamper-evident bag is the first step in mitigating this type of sophisticated attack.

You will see the tamper-evident words "void" appear when the seal is opened. Inside you will find your new COLDCARD, the Wallet Recovery Backup Card, sticker(s), and an additional copy of the bag number which should match the bag number printed on the outside of the bag.

If everything looks good, then you are ready to power on your new COLDCARD and get it setup. Here is a diagram you can reference to learn the COLDCARD's navigation:
